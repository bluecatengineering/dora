Description: Modern DHCP server written in Rust
 dora is a DHCP server written in Rust using tokio. It is built on the
 dhcproto library and sqlx with sqlite backend. The goal of dora is to
 provide a complete, performant, and correct implementation of DHCPv4,
 and eventually DHCPv6.
 .
 Features:
  * Async architecture with tokio for high performance
  * DHCPv4 support with RFC compliance
  * Duplicate address detection with ping
  * Binding multiple interfaces
  * Static address assignments
  * Client classes support
  * Dynamic DNS (DDNS) updates
  * Prometheus metrics endpoint
  * HTTP API for leases and configuration
  * SQLite database for lease management
  * JSON/YAML configuration format
 .
 dora is designed for modern network environments requiring a fast,
 reliable, and feature-rich DHCP server.
