# Example Client Classifier
# 
# We define in the dora config a client_classes section, where each class has a predicate whose syntax 
# is identical to Kea's expression syntax. At least initially, all client classes will be evaluated when a packet is received. 
# The classes will be evaluated in topological order, according to their dependencies.
# A range/reservation can then define a client_class field with the name of a class that will restrict 
# that range/reservation to only allow packets that have evaluated the associated client class predicate to true.
#
# Ex.
# ```
# client_classes:
#   v4:
#     -   name: my_class
#         assert: <some expression that evaluates to true/false>
#         options:
#           <options data>
# networks:
#     192.168.1.100/30:                         
#         ranges:
#             -                                 
#                 class: my_class
#                 ...
# ```
# 
# Dora does not allow the same level of configuration as Kea (right now). 
# We will not allow classes to be set on subnets, only ranges/reservations. 
# This follows with dora’s generally ‘flattened’ config structure. 
# This doesn’t close the door on adding those features in the future, just defines a minimum set of functionality.
# DHCP message flow:
# 
#    - Dora receives a DHCP packet, it evaluates any globally defined client classes. 
#       Dora attaches matching classes to the currently processing message
#    - Dora uses subnet selection logic to determine which top level network 
#       a given message should get its IP from (giaddr/ iaddr and opts like subnet select & relay agent info).
#    - Dora checks to see if any static IP reservations exist with matching client classes, if so it uses that reservation, 
#       potentially with option/config data from the client class. Precedence for option data goes to the reservation 
#       over any client class data.
#    - Dora iterates ranges in the network and if any client class is defined for the range, it checks 
#       to see that the packet evaluated a match for that client class-- i.e. the packet’s matching classes 
#       must contain the range’s class if it exists. Range precedence is set by index in the range list. 
#       Precedence for option data goes to the range over any client class option data.
#    - If, during iterating through ranges, there are classless ranges, we attempt to assign an IP 
#       from the classless range. If the packet has classes associated with it, it may get 
#       option data from those classes, but it can still have an IP assigned from a classless range.
#    - Continue normal execution
# 
# Note on precedence: If multiple client classes are applied to an incoming message, 
# the options given to the client will be the union of all matching client classes. 
# Where there is a duplicate, precedence will be given in the order it was evaluated.
#
# Predicate evaluation:
# see: https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/kea-2.2.0/arm/classify.html#using-expressions-in-classification
# and if anything you want isn't supported yet file a ticket asking us to work on it!

#   infix: == != or and (`1 == 1 and 2 != 3 or true`)
#
#   options: option[12]
#    option[xx].hex: gets the byte string data section of option[12] (`option[12].hex == 'hostname'`)
#    option[xx].exists: returns true/false if the option exists (`option[12].exists`)
