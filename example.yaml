# Example Client Classifier
#
# We define in the dora config a client_classes section, where each class has a predicate whose syntax
# is identical to Kea's expression syntax. At least initially, all client classes will be evaluated when a packet is received.
# The classes will be evaluated in topological order, according to their dependencies. Option precedence will still be
# given by the order in the config.
# A range/reservation can then define a client_class field with the name of a class that will restrict
# that range/reservation to only allow packets that have evaluated the associated client class predicate to true.
#
# Ex.
# ```
# client_classes:
#   v4:
#     -   name: my_class
#         assert: <some expression that evaluates to true/false>
#         options:
#           <options data>
# networks:
#     192.168.1.100/30:
#         ranges:
#             -
#                 class: my_class
#                 ...
# ```
#
# Dora does not allow the same level of configuration as Kea (right now).
# We will not allow classes to be set on subnets, only ranges/reservations.
# This follows with dora’s generally ‘flattened’ config structure.
# This doesn’t close the door on adding those features in the future, just defines a minimum set of functionality.
# DHCP message flow:
#
#    - Dora receives a DHCP packet, it evaluates any globally defined client classes.
#       Dora attaches matching classes to the currently processing message
#    - Dora uses subnet selection logic to determine which top level network
#       a given message should get its IP from (giaddr/ iaddr and opts like subnet select & relay agent info).
#    - Dora checks to see if any static IP reservations exist with matching client classes, if so it uses that reservation,
#       potentially with option/config data from the client class. Precedence for option data goes to the reservation
#       over any client class data.
#    - Dora iterates ranges in the network and if any client class is defined for the range, it checks
#       to see that the packet evaluated a match for that client class-- i.e. the packet’s matching classes
#       must contain the range’s class if it exists. Range precedence is set by index in the range list.
#       Precedence for option data goes to the range over any client class option data.
#    - If, during iterating through ranges, there are classless ranges, we attempt to assign an IP
#       from the classless range. If the packet has classes associated with it, it may get
#       option data from those classes, but it can still have an IP assigned from a classless range.
#    - Continue normal execution
#
# Note on precedence: If multiple client classes are applied to an incoming message,
# the options given to the client will be the union of all matching client classes.
# Where there is a duplicate, precedence will be given in the order it was evaluated.
#
# Predicate evaluation:

# Currently supports all grammar defined in the `grammar.pest` file in libs/client-classification:
#
#   primitives: integer (123), 'string', ip (1.2.3.4), 0xhex, true/false
#
#   prefix: not (`not false`)
#
#   infix: == != or and (`1 == 1 and 2 != 3 or true`)
#
#   options: option[12]
#    option[xx].hex: gets the data as a byte string.
#       You can still compare with 'strings' as long as the byte representation matches (`option[12].hex == 'hostname'` or `option[244].hex == 0x1234`)
#    option[xx].text: gets the data as a utf-8 encoded string (`option[12].text == 'hostname'`)
#    option[xx].exists: returns true/false if the option exists (`option[12].exists`)
#
#   pkt header:
#       pkt4.mac: chaddr in DHCP message header (`pkt4.mac == 0xDEADBEEF`)
#
#   substring(expr, start, len): substring function (`substring('foobar', 0, 3) == 'foo'`)
#
#   concat(expr, concat): concat function (`concat('foo', 'bar') == 'foobar')
#
#   ifelse(expr, expr_a, expr_b): if else control flow, first expression must evaluate to true/false
#                       and if true expr_a will return else expr_b
#
#   hexstring(pkt4.mac, ':'): turns bytes into a string separated by the separator string
#                       ex. hexstring(pkt4.mac, ':') == '66:6f:6f'
#                        (if pkt4.mac is '0x666f6f')
#
#   member('classname'): reference another class using the `member('my_class')` function. Dependency
#                   cycles will fail to parse the config.
#
# example:
#
#       `substring(option[61].hex, 0, 3) == 'foo'`
#
#  Vendor classes:
#
#   To match on the standard option 60 vendor class identifier, use `option[60].hex` or `option[60].text`
#   in your assertion— depending if you want a byte string or utf-8 string representation.
#   You can then specify options for the class providing option 43, for the encapsulated vendor options.
#   example.
#       name: my_vendor_class
#       assert: "option[60].hex == 'MSFT5.0'"
#       options:
#           values:
#              43:
#                  type: sub_option
#                  value:
#                      1:
#                          type: str
#                          value: "foobar"
#                      2:
#                          type: ip
#                          value: 1.2.3.4
#
#   Attaching `my_vendor_class` to a range/reservation will provide the defined opt 43 vendor options.
