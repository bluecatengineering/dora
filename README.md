# dora (dhcp server)

![](dora.jpg)

`dora` is a DHCP server written in Rust using tokio. It is built on the [`dhcproto`](https://github.com/bluecatengineering/dhcproto) library and `sqlx`. We currently use the sqlite backend, although that could change in the future. The goal of `dora` is to provide a complete DHCP implementation for IPv4, and eventually IPv6. Dora supports duplicate address detection, ping, binding multiple interfaces, static addresses, etc [see example.yaml for all options](./example.yaml).

It is, however, an **early release version** and may contain bugs. We hope to build an active community around this project so we can create a new DHCP server together. PRs, issues, and constructive comments are welcome.

You can see all the options available by looking through `example.yaml`. `dora` will parse equivalent JSON or YAML formats of the schema.

If started on non-default dhcp port, it is assumed this is for testing, and dora will unicast any response back rather than following the RFC.

## Features

[see example.yaml for all available options](./example.yaml). |

## Build/Run

You will need `sqlx-cli` to build, as sql queries written in Rust are checked against the database at compile time. [Install sqlx-cli](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx-cli)

From workspace root run:

```
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run
```

This should create the `em.db` database specified in `.env`, it uses the `DATABASE_URL` env var so make sure that's not in use elsewhere, it can also be passed using `-d/--database-url`.

Use standard cargo subcommands to build (with the `--release` flag for no debug symbols):

```
cargo build
```

and run (by default dora will try to bind to privileged ports, which may require sudo), see the main dora binary [README](bin/README.md) for parameters.

Or run help:

```
cargo run --bin dora -- --help
```

`dora` requires a config file to start. See [example.yaml](./example.yaml) for all available options.

Use `DORA_LOG` env var for adjusting log level and which targets, see [here](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.20/tracing_subscriber/fmt/index.html#filtering-events-with-environment-variables) for more options.

### Cross compiling to ARM

#### Using cross

There is a project called `cross` that does most of the heavy lifting and will build everything in a container, this is the first thing to try. Note that [you will need either docker or podman](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross#dependencies), so we recommend that you install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) if you have not yet done so.

```
cargo install cross
cross build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --bin dora --release
```

**Note** Remember to pass `--release` to `cross` if you want an optimized version of the binary

You can compile for the `musl` target also, although it will not have `jemallocator`:

```
cross build --target armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf --bin dora --release
```

If that works, you should have a `dora` binary in `target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/dora` or `target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/release/dora`

#### Not using cross

Firstly, you need the ARM toolchain from rustup:

```
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

Notice that `.cargo/config.toml` has an entry for replacing the linker when cross compiling to ARM:

```
[target.armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
```

This means `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` must be available on the system and will be used as the linker. Once you have it installed, you can produce an ARMv7 binary using:

```
TARGET_CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc TARGET_AR=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-ar cargo build --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --bin dora
```

## Dora options & environment vars

[see dora bin readme](bin/README.md)

## Config format

There is a tool included in the workspace called `dora-cfg`, you can run it with:

```
cargo run --bin dora-cfg -- <args>
```

It will pretty-print the internal dora config representation as well as parse the wire format so hex encoded values are human-readable.

[see dora-cfg readme](dora-cfg/README.md)

## Performance

In synthetic tests with `perfdhcp` I was able to get to around 5000 leases/sec, but `dora` was nowhere near close to consuming available CPU. `dora` keeps no leases in memory at the moment. It relies totally on the database in order to determine which is the next IP to allocate within a range. The db workload is fairly write-heavy, and `sqlite` seems to bottleneck the tokio runtime at a certain point.

We _could_ go much faster by keeping leases in memory and appending to the db like more traditional DHCP implementations, but this is a trade-off for complexity. I've experimented with the bitmap from `roaring-rs` and it seems pretty fast, although we'd need logic to reload the database into memory again on startup and be able to evict entries after lease expiration. Additional complexity we don't care for at the moment. There may be other ways to squeeze more performance out without having to go down this road.

## Troubleshooting/Testing

### Using perfdhcp

[perfdhcp](https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/kea-2.0.1/man/perfdhcp.8.html) can be used to test dora, include `giaddr`, the subnet select option or the relay agent link selection opt, you can use this as a starting point:

```
sudo perfdhcp -4 -N 9901 -L 9903 -r 1 -xi -t 1 -o 118,C0A80001 -R 100 127.0.0.1
```

This will start perfdhcp using dhcpv4, send messages to `127.0.0.1:9901`, listen on port `9903` at a rate of 1/sec, and using 100 different devices. It includes the subnet select opt (118) with `C0A80001` as a hex encoded value of the integer of `192.168.0.1`. `dora` must be listening on `9901` and have a config with ranges to allocate on the `192.168.0.1` network.

### Setting up dora on the PI

See [PI setup](./docs/pi_setup.md)

### Other issues?

If you find a bug, or see something that doesn't look right, please open an issue and let us know. We welcome any and all constructive feedback.

We're still actively working on this. Some of the things we'd like to add in the future include: DDNS updates, stateful DHCPv6, HA & Client classification.
